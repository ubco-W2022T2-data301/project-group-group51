## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words 

{we are interested in airline flight data and analylising the truely best airline. as we will take into account the unbiased parts of airtravel like: all sorts of delays, on time arrivals, late departures and much more. Also within other data sets we will look into lost baggage data. we will be comparing all U.S.A Based airlines, the data curated will be from pre covid times as these seem to be the baseline for the actual data. However we will take into regard newer data as well as during covid as it is valueable data on what airlines were able to perform the best during questionable times. Also an important experience of airtravel is the flight being oversold, undersold we will regard this data highly as this shows the true redundancy of the airline.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{We will be using multiple data sets from diffrent resources as simply one data set is not enough, we will take all data of arrivals, cancelations, delays, weather and much more sub variables into account for our descition on what airline is truely the "best". our next datasets will take in baggage delays and the mishandleing of baggage in all by each airline. using all of this data we will curate and show the readers of this data the true hurdles and struggles that each airline stuggles with throughout certain fiscal years and months.}
